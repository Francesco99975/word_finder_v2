# Word Finder V2

##

A rust re-implementation of one of my very first projects. A console program, that takes a sequence of letters and spits out all the possible word that can be made out of them.

I used an english dictionary from [dwyl's Github Repo](https://github.com/dwyl/english-words/blob/master/words.txt), but any dictionary file can be used.
